 - Need to find a better way to check if metro apps are running
 - Need to detect if full-screen apps are running and disable the polling
 - Make buttons/shortcuts customizable
 - make the layout prettier
 - Wireless: query battery info only every odd/x cycles of updating when polling is started, to save some performance (battery info aren't changing that often)
 - Add mouse controls
 - make left and right during RWIN+TAB snap the currently highlighted/selected window to the left/right
 - make dpad inputs repeated presses (e.g. when holding left on the keyboard your cursor moves until key-up, but on the controller it currently does not) (does not work because we only get the callback that the input changed once so there is no continuous input)
 - make the toast notification work
 - make it autostart with windows
